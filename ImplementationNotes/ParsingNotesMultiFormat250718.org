#+title: Parsing Notes Multi Format250718

* For each joint - variable naming alternatives

** 1. Variable names (\x, \y, etc)
** 2. Indices (0, 1, 2, etc)
** 3. Group the buses of each joint in one object.

* Use a canonical list of joint names

Define the list. (eg. based on Rokoko)
Define mappings of different lists (eg Yolo) to the canonical list.

Group the input values belonging to each joint into that joint.

* Define different osc messages that send single joints

* Prototype for a single-joint-sending protocol (see current GODOT protocol)

Use GODOT protocol of current version as starting point.
