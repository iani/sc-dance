* ÁÅ´ 15  7 2025 21:04: Fix start, synths and msg value gui display

** 1st Priority - relates to valuesGui and sound below: Check how messages set msg bus

Probably refixing msg routine I left out the statement that set the msgbus with the message values.  New feature idea: Add option for switching between setting the message bus with the unfiltered *or* the filtered messages.

** Start: Add removeSynths, removeFilters
** Maybe new method: Avatar.removeCtls (shortcut for removeSynths, removeFilters)? Check!!!
** Fix Avatar.valuesGui: msg values do not update
** Fix Avatar.addSynth with sound funcs. They don't seem to get msg bus controls.
